This is a series of free audio plug-ins created by Filipe Chagas for mixing and mastering music and audiovisual productions. The Essential Plugins Series is intended to be a series of simple plugins with basic functions.

Plugins are currently under development, so they may have bugs (it will be very helpful if you report them). Also, they are temporarily only available as VST3 for Windows.

# Essential EQ (EEQ-1)

Essential EQ is a 4-band parametric equalizer: low, mid-low, high-low, and high. these bands correspond, respectively, to bass, mid-bass, mid-treble and treble. In addition to the 4 bands, there is treble (high) and bass (low) cut with adjustable slope. There is no frequency response or FFT display, so you must be guided by your ear to use this equalizer.

# Essential Filter (EF-1)

EF-1 is a low pass or high pass audio filter plugin, with adjustable frequency between 20Hz and 20kHz, adjustable slope from 6dB/oct to 60dB/oct and phase inversion switch.

# Essential Drum Compressor (EDC-1)

EDC-1 is a dynamic range compressor with slow attack and almost fast release. This compressor is dedicated to percussion mixing, but can also sound great in other applications.

### About no-installer download links

There are download links for plugins without an installer. These links may be the only ones available or an option for those who don't feel safe with executable installers. Basically, these links lead to zip files containing the respective raw files of the plugins (files ".vst3" in case the plugin is VST3 for Windows). These files must be manually installed following the instructions below:

| Format | Procedure |
|----|----|
| VST3 for Windows | Move the ".vst3" file to the "Program Files/Common Files/VST3" directory. |


### How to report bugs

Send me an email with the subject "\{plug-in name\} bug report" (obviously, you should put the name of the plugin you identified a bug with instead of "\{plug-in name\}" ). In the body of the email, provide the following information:

* The version of the plug-in you were using
* The source you downloaded from (if you downloaded from this website, just write "official website")
* The operating system you were using when the bug happened
* The DAW you were using when the bug happened
* The sample rate and buffer size you were using when the bug happened
* A detailed description of the bug
  * If the bug is visual, consider attaching screenshots and screencasts
  * If the bug is audible (which is more serious), consider attaching audio processed by the plugin along with screenshots of its settings

The email can be written in English or Portuguese. Don't be rude, I'm not charging you for plugins ðŸ˜‰.
