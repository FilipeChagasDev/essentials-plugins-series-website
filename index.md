This is a series of free audio plug-ins created by Filipe Chagas for mixing and mastering music and audiovisual productions. The Essential Plugins Series is intended to be a series of simple plugins with basic functions.

Plugins are currently under development, so they may have bugs (it will be very helpful if you report them). Also, they are temporarily only available as VST3 for Windows.

# Essential EQ (EEQ-1)

Essential EQ is a 4-band parametric equalizer: low, mid-low, high-low, and high. these bands correspond, respectively, to bass, mid-bass, mid-treble and treble. In addition to the 4 bands, there is treble (high) and bass (low) cut with adjustable slope. There is no frequency response or FFT display, so you must be guided by your ear to use this equalizer.
