This is a series of free audio plug-ins created by Filipe Chagas for mixing and mastering music and audiovisual productions. The Essential Plugins Series is intended to be a series of simple plugins with basic functions.

Plugins are currently under development, so they may have bugs (it will be very helpful if you report them). Also, they are temporarily only available as VST3 for Windows.
